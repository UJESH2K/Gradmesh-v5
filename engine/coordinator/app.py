"""GradMesh v4 coordinator.

One FastAPI process owns the whole control plane: node registry, admission,
round planning, shard materialisation, the round barrier, aggregation, run
history and the live event stream.

What changed from v3, and why:

* Shards are sized per node from measured throughput instead of split evenly, so
  a slow laptop no longer sets the pace for the whole mesh.
* A background supervisor enforces per-shard deadlines, so a machine that goes
  to sleep mid-round costs the run seconds rather than the lease timeout.
* Aggregation is sample-weighted, which is what unequal shards require.
* Datasets are uploaded through the dashboard and stored in a registry, so the
  strawberry ZIP is one dataset among many rather than a hard-coded path.
* Every transition is published to an event bus that the dashboard streams.

The training pipeline itself is unchanged. Workers still receive a shard zip, a
base checkpoint and a global state dict, and still run the same Ultralytics call
that v3 validated, including the Intel XPU path.
