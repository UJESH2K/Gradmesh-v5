"""Finding things on the local network, in both directions.

Two problems, and they are not the same problem.

**A device needs to find the host.** Telling someone "open http://192.168.1.85:3000"
fails the moment the router hands out a new lease, and nobody wants to read an
IP address off a screen. So the coordinator advertises itself over multicast DNS
and claims the name `gradmesh.local`. Any device on the network with an mDNS
resolver, which is Windows 10 and later, macOS, iOS, Android 12 and later and
most desktop Linux, can then just open `http://gradmesh.local:3000` with no
setup on either side.

**The host needs to see what is out there.** `scan_network()` sweeps the local
subnet so the dashboard can show every device on the Wi-Fi, which of them are
already contributing, and which are sitting there with a GPU doing nothing.

Liveness detection uses a detail worth stating: a TCP connection that is
*refused* proves a host exists just as well as one that is accepted. Only a
timeout means nothing is there. So probing a couple of common ports finds
devices that answer nothing at all, which is most phones and laptops.
