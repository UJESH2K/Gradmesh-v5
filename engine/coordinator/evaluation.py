"""Accuracy measurement for the aggregated global model.

Speedup without accuracy is not a result. A mesh that trains four times faster
and loses ten points of mAP has not accelerated anything, so every claim in the
benchmark is paired with a measured accuracy on a held-out split.

Three decisions here exist so the numbers survive review.

**Evaluation happens on the coordinator, not on a worker.** Every configuration
in a sweep is then scored by the same code on the same machine against the same
images. Farming evaluation out to whichever worker was idle would make accuracy
depend on which GPU ran it, which is exactly the confound a controlled
comparison has to exclude.

**Evaluation time is never counted as training time.** It is timed separately
and reported separately. Otherwise a configuration that evaluated more often
would look slower for reasons that have nothing to do with distribution.

**The validation split is the parent dataset's, always.** A 100-image subset and
a 10000-image subset of the same dataset are scored against identical held-out
images, so a change in mAP is a change in what was learned rather than a change
in what was measured.
