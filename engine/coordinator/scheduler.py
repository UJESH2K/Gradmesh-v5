"""GradMesh heterogeneity-aware scheduler.

The v3 coordinator split a dataset into equal shards and then waited for the
slowest machine. On a mesh of consumer hardware that is the wrong policy: a
round costs max_i(t_i), so an equal split makes the weakest GPU set the pace for
everyone and the mesh gets *slower* as you add machines.

This module replaces that with four cooperating policies.

1. Admission control. A device is measured, not trusted. admit() decides whether
   a node may hold a shard at all, and at which tier.
2. Predictive proportional sharding. plan_round() sizes each shard so every
   admitted worker is predicted to finish at the same instant, which minimises
   round makespan instead of round variance.
3. Straggler mitigation. deadline_for() derives a soft and hard deadline from
   the same prediction. A soft miss triggers speculative re-execution on an idle
   fast worker; a hard miss drops the shard from the barrier and returns its
   samples to the next round's plan.
4. Contribution-weighted aggregation. aggregation_weights() weights each
   worker's state dict by the samples it actually trained on, damped by that
   worker's reliability, which is the correct FedAvg estimator for unequal
   shards.

Everything here is a pure function over plain dicts so the policy can be unit
tested and reported in the paper independently of FastAPI.
