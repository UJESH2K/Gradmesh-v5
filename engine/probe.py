"""Device capability probe.

Every worker runs this once at startup and reports the result to the
coordinator. The coordinator's admission gate and shard planner need a number
that is comparable across NVIDIA, Intel and CPU devices, and vendor-reported
specs are not comparable. So we measure the one thing that actually predicts
YOLO step time: sustained fused-multiply-add throughput at a realistic tile
size, plus the memory ceiling that bounds batch size.

The probe is deliberately short (a few hundred milliseconds). It is a ranking
signal, not a benchmark suite.
